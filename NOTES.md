## Notes:

* 30Aug2025 - tested prototype0
  - All parts seem functional, both at 5V of programmer & 3V of AA batteries
  - Idle current: 15 mA at 10 MHz, 10 mA at 8 MHz
  - Don't set to 4 MHz, it doesn't work. LEDs go all white (drawing 300mA)
  - To-Do: 
    - edit light mask polygons on back to be wider
    - move LEDs out from under battery holder
    - change UDPI prog footprint to female SMD RA header socket
  
* 21Aug2025 - prototype0 sent to JLC, with "21 Aug 2025" datestamp

* 16Aug2025 - basic graphics test, got okay from leeborg
