## Notes:

* 1 Oct 2025 - 48 badges mailed to Paris

* 29 Sep 2025 - Start 3D printing protective "backer"

* 29 Sep 2025 - "final" firmware and batch programming / testing
  - all boards passed basic programming & lighting test

* 23 Sep 2025 - Badge PCBAs delivered from JLC
  - badge final assembly: battery holder, SAO header

* 11 Sep 2025 - PCBway wanted $1k for badges, ordered JLC instead

* 30 Aug 2025 - tested prototype0
  - All parts seem functional, both at 5V of programmer & 3V of AA batteries
  - Idle current: 15 mA at 10 MHz, 10 mA at 8 MHz
  - Don't set to 4 MHz, it doesn't work. LEDs go all white (drawing 300mA)
  - To-Do:
    - edit light mask polygons on back to be wider
    - move LEDs out from under battery holder
    - change UDPI prog footprint to female SMD RA header socket

* 21 Aug 2025 - prototype0 sent to JLC, with "21 Aug 2025" datestamp

* 16 Aug 2025 - basic graphics import test, got okay from leeborg
